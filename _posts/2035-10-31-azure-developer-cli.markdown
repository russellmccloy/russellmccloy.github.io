My findings about the Azure Developer CLI

## Installation

You can find out how to install it here:  
[https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/install-azd?tabs=winget-windows%2Cbrew-mac%2Cscript-linux&pivots=os-windows](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/install-azd?tabs=winget-windows%2Cbrew-mac%2Cscript-linux&pivots=os-windows)

I installed in on my Windows box:

```powershell
winget install microsoft.azd
```

## Why Would I use the Azure Developer CLI

If you are not skilled up on Azure Architecture and Best Practices it seems like the Azure Developer CLI is built with you in mind. Using an Azure Developer CLI template, you can use the Azure Developer CLI to create and deploy applications to the Azure Cloud. These templates adhere to best practices and take care of things like:

* The **infrastructure** that your application requires
* Your **application** code
* A **database** if you need it

## Azure Developer CLI templates

There are many open source templates available that are written by Microsoft and other developers. To see the available templates you can look at this link [Azure Developer CLI templates](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/azd-templates?tabs=csharp#choose-a-template). There is also a list of open source templates here [https://azure.github.io/awesome-azd/](https://azure.github.io/awesome-azd/) or run the following command:

```powershell
azd template list
```

I am going to attempt to use the following template: [https://github.com/Azure-Samples/todo-csharp-sql](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/todo-csharp-sql) which is described as:

> A blueprint for getting a React web app with a C# API and a SQL database on Azure. The blueprint includes sample application code (a ToDo web app) which can be removed and replaced with your own application code. Add your own source code and leverage the Infrastructure as Code assets (written in Bicep) to get up and running quickly.

Iam going to follow the instructions in the `README` [here](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/todo-csharp-sql/blob/main/README.md) and make write down what I do and find as I go.

## Steps in Summary and my findings

* Ensure I have all the **Prerequisites** install on my machine - âœ…
  * Regarding `Node.js` I opted to install the latest version [20.8.0](https://nodejs.org/dist/v20.8.0/node-v20.8.0-x64.msi)
* Log in to azd. `azd auth login`
  
  ```powershell
  PS C:\Users\RussellMcCloy\code> azd auth login
  Logged in to Azure.
  ```
* Make a new directory for `todo-csharp-sql` and navigate to it
* Run:
  
  ```powershell
  azd init --template Azure-Samples/todo-csharp-sql
  ```

* I was prompted to enter a new environment name and as I didn't totally understand what it was asking I enter `?` and the following was displayed:

  ![New Environment](../assets/azd_enter_env_name.png)

  * I entered: `todo-csharp-sql-dev` as now it was clear that I may want more than one environment in Azure such as `dev`, `test` and `prod` for example.

* After this I got a successful message: `SUCCESS: New project initialized!`

* I then opened the folder I made earlier in VSCode and could see a list of all the files locally that were created by the template:

![Files created by the template](../assets/azd_file_system_in_vscode.png)

* I decided to push these to a new GitHub repository I just created so I can revert anything that I might break along this journey.

* Next I ran the following command to provision everything in Azure:

```powershell
# Provision and deploy to Azure
azd up
```

* Hopefully I end up with this:

  ![DesiredArchitecture](../assets/azd_architecture.png)

* I was then prompted for the following:
  * Azure subscription
  * Region - I put it in Brazil South as that is where I am sitting now
  * After that, everything was packaged up into zip files and deployed. This took about 15 minutes and to be honest, when does a Microsoft demo ever work 100%? Well it did (I apologise for the horrible light PowerShell theme but I am sitting by the pool and the sun is very bright!):

  ![Success!](../assets/azd_up_deployment_success.png)

* If I look in Azure I can see all my resources:

  ![All Azure Resources Deployed](../assets/azd_all_azure_resources.png)

* Then I looked at the API that backs the website:

  ![API Swagger](../assets/azd_swagger.png)

* and then the website its self:

  ![Web Front End](../assets/azd_web_front_end.png)

* As you can see, I even added a `TODO` item expecting things to fail and everything worked as expected ðŸ˜²

## Next Steps

Ok so that was a very nice experience but I don't want to ever really deploy from my local straight to Azure. I would prefer to deploy using **CI/ CD** so next, I will attempt to do this whilst still following the instructions [here](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/todo-csharp-sql/blob/main/README.md)

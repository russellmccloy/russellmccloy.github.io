## Welcome

Hi there. This is my new technical blog.

I usually keep a blog but have got a bit lazy of the past few months with regard to keeping it up to date. I also struggled with a decent blogging platform and this morning I found <https://jekyllrb.com/>.

**Jekyll** allows me to write my blog within **VSCode** and push to a **GitHub** repository to publish it. I really like this as it fits with the workflow that I use every day in my development practices.

**I like writing and having a blog for the following reasons:**

- It helps me solidify my learning by forcing me to write it down. I feel this helps fully embed the knowledge in my slightly forgetful mind.
- It is not to show off but, if it helps others, that's great.
- It's guaranteed job interview question and I suppose it can immediately instill confidence in a prospective employer.

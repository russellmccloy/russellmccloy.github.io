Hi, and welcome to my technical blog. I will attempt to keep this updated with anything I find that, I think, may help the community or a reminder to myself as to how I did things. (*my memory is not that goodðŸ˜Š)

My current list of main technical skill are:

- DevOps
- Automation
- Terraform
- Testing
- Golang
- Python
- .NET

> Note: My main cloud is Azure and you won't find much about other cloud platforms here.

Within this blog you will see post fitting into the following type of thing:

- **How Tos**: Information I discover in my day to day work that I think might interest others
- **Code Snippets**: Small code snippets that I think will benefit others or remind me how I did something when I try to do it again in six months.
- **POCs**: Proof of concept that I document as I go.

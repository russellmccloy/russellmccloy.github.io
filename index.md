Hi, and welcome to my technical blog. I will attempt to keep this updated with anything I find useful and may help the community or as a reminder to myself how I did things. The articles in the blog will generally focus on the below list of skills and technologies.

Recently I have spent nearly 2 years in Brazil whilst continuing to work for Lab3 (an Australian company) in an opposite timezone. At times this was challenging  but I have learned a lot from the experience in terms of the need for clear communication, documentation and patience!

In November 2023 myself and my family moved to Belfast, Northern Ireland and I am currently looking for work with a UK company.

A knowledge worker is a term coined by management consultant and author Peter Drucker in the late 1950s to describe individuals who primarily handle or manage information, knowledge, and data in their jobs. Unlike traditional manual laborers, knowledge workers primarily deal with tasks that involve the creation, analysis, synthesis, or application of knowledge. This category of workers typically includes professionals such as engineers, scientists, lawyers, doctors, educators, consultants, researchers, analysts, writers, designers, programmers, and others who rely heavily on their intellect and expertise to perform their work effectively. Knowledge workers often require higher levels of education, critical thinking skills, problem-solving abilities, and creativity to succeed in their roles. They are essential in the modern economy, particularly in sectors such as technology, finance, healthcare, education, and professional services, where knowledge and information play a crucial role in driving innovation, decision-making, and problem-solving.

This post outlines how to setup a static website with Jekyll and how you can have a good looking blog whilst only using a text editor and markdown. The reason for this post is because I think it is important to write about your skills and what you learn. 
it shows your enthusiasm for what you do and, to be honest, is quite satisfying as having a blog kind of forces you to expose what you are doing to others. This, in combination with your CV / resume shows that you are keeping up with the latest development practices as well as showing you have a passion for the work you do.

Over the years I have used various blogging platforms and usually found that, whilst they do the job, are quite annoying and sometimes don't do what you want them to do. That is why I have started using Jekyll as I can quickly, using a test editor locally (Visual Studio Code) write a blog post in **markdown** without having to worry about anything apart from the content of my post.

I have also used a Jekyll template designed by [Dean Attali](https://deanattali.com/) because I am not a front end developer and never want to be. This enables me to have a good looking blog without the painful overhead of building it myself.

From November 2023 up until approximately April 2024 I decided to look at my life and what was important for my family and I right now. After much thought, I decided to spend 6 months focussing on my family and in particular, spending high quality time with my 3 year old daughter. During this time we decided to spend time in Northern Ireland with my dad and more time in Brazil with my wife's family before heading back to Australia to start *normal* life again. This post outlines some of the benefits and thoughts that arose after this 6 month period.

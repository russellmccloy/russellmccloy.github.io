Russell is a highly motivated and driven professional that achieves results though a pragmatic approach. He has gained a diverse range of experience from working in the IT industry for more than 24 years in Sydney, London, Melbourne and Brazil and has become a well-rounded and knowledgeable individual with a broad skill set.

Russell is an advocate for all things cloud having extensive experience and knowledge in this area. He is passionate about what he does and is able to establish trusting relationships with his clients and colleagues by delivering on their business objectives and treating everyone with the respect they deserve.

Obviously, I am flexible but ideally, I am looking for a new, fully remote, UK developer role working with a team of Azure developers designing and building applications in the cloud.
